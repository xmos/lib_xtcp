/** sys_prot_t sys_arch_protect(void)

This optional function does a "fast" critical region protection and returns
the previous protection level. This function is only called during very short
critical regions. An embedded system which supports ISR-based drivers might
want to implement this function by disabling interrupts. Task-based systems
might want to implement this by using a mutex or disabling tasking. This
function should support recursive calls from the same task or interrupt. In
other words, sys_arch_protect() could be called while already protected. In
that case the return value indicates that it is already protected.

sys_arch_protect() is only required if your port is supporting an operating
system.
